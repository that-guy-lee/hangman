## How to play

Playing the game is very simple. 
The objective is to guess the word that the computer selected.
You'll see a few lines on the bottom of the screen indicating how many letters or charaters make up the word.
Type a letter on your keyboard that you think is in the word. If the letter takes the place of one or more of the lines, you've guessed correctly.
If not, you will see the letter appear under "Wrong letters".

If you run out of guesses, you loose the game. If you guess the word correctly, you win.
